= Quarkus WireMock Extension Demo

Demonstrates how to use the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-wiremock/dev/index.html[Quarkus WireMock Extension]... with a little helper for the mocking.

The two interesting classes are:

- `WireMocker` - allows to do the stubbing a litte bit like Mockito with JAX-RS API interfaces.
Reduce boilerplate code for the mocking.
- `NameServiceStandardMappings` - a WireMock extension that adds default stubs.
Very useful while running Quarkus in dev mode.

== Running

To see it all in action, simply run:

[source,shell]
----
