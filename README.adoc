= Quarkus WireMock Extension Demo

Demonstrates how to use the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-wiremock/dev/index.html[Quarkus WireMock Extension]... with a little helper for the mocking.

The two interesting classes are:

- https://github.com/t1/quarkus-wiremock-demo/blob/trunk/src/test/java/com/github/t1/WireMocker.java[`WireMocker`] - allows to do the stubbing a litte bit like Mockito with JAX-RS API interfaces.
Reduce boilerplate code for the mocking.
- https://github.com/t1/quarkus-wiremock-demo/blob/trunk/src/test/java/com/github/t1/NameServiceStandardMappings.java[`NameServiceStandardMappings`] - a WireMock extension that adds default stubs.
Very useful while running Quarkus in dev mode.
